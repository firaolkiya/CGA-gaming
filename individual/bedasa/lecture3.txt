Lesson 3: Drawing in Game Lab
In this lesson, i explore the challenges of communicating clear instructions using a Game Lab tool to draw shapes on the Game Lab's grid!
I understand The Game Lab tool provides various commands and options for drawing shapes on its grid. 
       # list of the commonly used tools and methods:
1. Basic Shapes
    rect(x, y): Draws a rectangle with the specified position and dimensions.
    ellipse(x, y): Draws an ellipse (oval or circle) centered at (x, y).
2. Styling Shapes
    fill(color): Sets the fill color for shapes.
    background(): sets the color of the canvas or screen in Game Lab.
    strokeWeight(weight): Sets the thickness of the outline.
3. Grid Control
    The Grid Toggle allows you to turn on or off a visible grid for easier alignment of shapes.
4. Coordinates System
    (x, y): Represents the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) positions on the grid. The top-left corner is (0, 0), with values increasing as you move right or down.


*****answer for skill building problem********
    
//1) Change the numbers inside the block, then try running the program again.
//2) Try to place the rectangle near the bottom right of the screen.
           rect(300,360);
// 3) Place two rectangles exactly in the corners of the screen
            rect(350,350);
            rect(0,0);
// 4) Change the color from blue to yellow.
            fill("yellow");
            rect(100,100);
            rect(250, 100);
// 5) Add a new square to the image
           rect(100, 250);
//6) Change the red rectangle's color to green.
//8) Change the order of the code so the green rectangle appears on top.
          fill("blue");
          rect(200, 200);
          fill("green");
          rect(175,175);
//9) Add a new ellipse of a different color.
          fill("orange");
          ellipse(250,250);
          fill("red");
          ellipse(100,100);
 ********answer for practice problem******
       Debugging: Fix the stoplight
//2) Rearrange the code so the colors are correct.
rect(175,100);
rect(175,150);
rect(175,200);
fill("black");
ellipse(200,125);
fill("red");
ellipse(200,175);
fill("green");
ellipse(200,225);
fill("black");
****** answer for assessment problem****
//) Change the code so it makes the picture in the instructions

      rect(150, 150);
      fill("orange");
      ellipse(150,150);
      ellipse(200,150);
      ellipse(150,200);
      ellipse(200,200);
      fill("purple");
********answer for challenges*********
//) Use the strokeWeight() block to finish the code so it matches the picture.
fill("ivory");
rect(160, 180);
point(170, 190);
point(185, 205);
point(200, 220);
