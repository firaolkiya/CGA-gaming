Lesson 2: Plotting Shapes
In this lesson, i will discover the importance of giving clear and precise instructions while using the Game Lab tool to draw shapes on its grid. 
This activity highlights how effective communication is key in programming and design.
Key Concepts to Explore:

   # Understanding the Grid:
        The Game Labâ€™s grid serves as a reference for placing shapes accurately.
        Each shape's position is defined by its coordinates (x, y) on the grid.

   # Precision in Instructions:
        Clear instructions are essential to ensure that shapes appear where and how they are intended.
        Miscommunication or incomplete directions can result in errors or unexpected results.

   # Using the Tool:
        Experiment with selecting different shapes, colors, and positions.
        Learn how to use the "Run" button and grid to visualize your designs.
