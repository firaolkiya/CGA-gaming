Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose
Here’s a generalized  my idea based on the provided questions and context:
Assessing Prior Knowledge:

    Understand the audience’s familiarity with computer science and interactive animations/games. 
    This helps in tailoring lessons and projects to their experience levels.

Engagement with Computer Science:

    Gauge how much users enjoy computer science to adjust the teaching approach, emphasizing fun and real-world applications for those less enthusiastic.

Self-Efficacy in Learning:

    Use their confidence in learning computer science to determine how much support or independent learning opportunities to provide.

Future Interest:

    Leverage their interest in taking more computer science classes by offering pathways, additional resources, or examples of career opportunities.
