In Lesson 5, I learned about variables and their importance in programming. A variable acts as a label for storing information, such as numbers, text, or positions of shapes, 
that can be reused or modified throughout a program. Variables are fundamental for making programs dynamic and efficient. 

The key benefits of using variables include reusability, as the same variable can be used in multiple places without repeating code; flexibility, 
since updating the value of a variable automatically applies changes wherever it is referenced; and simplified code, which becomes easier to read, understand, 
and debug. This lesson highlighted how variables are essential tools for organizing and streamlining code in any program.
