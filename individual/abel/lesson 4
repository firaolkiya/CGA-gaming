In Lesson 4, I learned about shapes and parameters in Game Lab, focusing on how to customize rectangles and ellipses beyond their default settings. The rect block,
which initially creates a square with sides of length 50, has two required inputs for x and y coordinates to define the position of the square's top-left corner. 
However, it also includes two optional parameters for width and height, which can be revealed or hidden using the arrow on the right-hand side of the block. 
This flexibility allows for precise control over the size and dimensions of rectangles.
Similarly, the ellipse block has optional width and height parameters in addition to its required x and y inputs, which specify the center of the ellipse. 
These optional parameters can also be toggled using the arrow on the block, making it easy to create circles or ellipses with customized dimensions. 
This lesson enhanced my understanding of using parameters to create shapes with more versatility and control.
