In this lesson, I learned about using random numbers in programming to introduce variability and unpredictability. The randomNumber() block allows the generation of 
random values within a specified range, making it useful for creating dynamic and ever-changing outputs. By incorporating random numbers as parameters in drawing 
commands, I discovered how to make graphics vary with each program run. Additionally, I learned that using multiple instances of randomNumber() generates independent 
random values, enabling the creation of more complex and randomized designs. This concept enhances creativity and flexibility in coding, allowing for more engaging 
and interactive projects.
