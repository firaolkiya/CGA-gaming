In this activity, I learned how to draw and customize shapes using a digital tool that offers a variety of creative options. I explored how to change 
the color of shapes by selecting a desired color before starting the drawing process, allowing for greater personalization and visual appeal. 
Each time I wanted to draw a new shape, I needed to click on the corresponding shape icon, which helped reinforce the concept of intentional design choices. 
To improve alignment and precision in my creations, I activated a grid by checking the grid box located below the "Run" button. 
Additionally, I discovered that clicking the "Run" button was essential to starting the program and enabling the drawing tool. This hands-on practice not only 
enhanced my understanding of how to create shapes but also gave me valuable insights into customizing and aligning designs effectively. It provided a solid 
foundation for working with design tools and exploring creative possibilities.
