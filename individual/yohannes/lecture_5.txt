Lesson 5 - Variables
Key Concepts
What is a Variable?

A variable is a label for a piece of information that can be stored and used in a program.
Variables allow you to save values like numbers, text, or even shapes' positions and reuse or change them as needed.
Why Use Variables?

Reusability: You can use the same variable in multiple places.
Flexibility: Changing the value of a variable updates all the places itâ€™s used.
Simplified Code: Makes the code easier to read, understand, and debug.
How to Declare Variables:

Declare and Assign:
javascript
Copy code
var x = 100; // Declares a variable 'x' and assigns it the value 100
Declare Only:
javascript
Copy code
var x; // Declares a variable 'x' without assigning a value
You can assign a value to it later:
javascript
Copy code
x = 50;
Using Variables:

Variables can be used as parameters in commands.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
var centerX = 200;
var centerY = 150;
var radius = 50;
ellipse(centerX, centerY, radius * 2, radius * 2);
Levels Overview
Prediction (Level 1):

Predict what a program will do when variables are used.
Predict (Level 2):

Observe how changing a variable affects the output.
Skill Building (Levels 3-5):

Learn to declare variables, assign values, and use them in drawing shapes.
Practice (Level 6):

Apply variables to draw more complex patterns or create interactive designs.
Assessment (Level 7):

Demonstrate your understanding by completing a task with variable use.
Challenges (Level 8):

Explore creative ways to use variables, such as for animations or dynamic designs.
Practical Example
Draw a dynamic face where the eyes and mouth positions can be adjusted using variables:

javascript
Copy code
// Variables for face position and size
var faceX = 200;
var faceY = 200;
var faceSize = 150;

// Variables for eye positions
var eyeOffsetX = 40;
var eyeOffsetY = 30;
var eyeSize = 20;

// Draw face
ellipse(faceX, faceY, faceSize, faceSize);

// Draw eyes
ellipse(faceX - eyeOffsetX, faceY - eyeOffsetY, eyeSize, eyeSize); // Left eye
ellipse(faceX + eyeOffsetX, faceY - eyeOffsetY, eyeSize, eyeSize); // Right eye

// Draw mouth
rect(faceX - 30, faceY + 20, 60, 10);
