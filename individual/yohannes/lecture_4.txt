Lesson 4 - Shapes and Parameters
Key Concepts
Using Parameters:

Parameters are inputs you provide to a command to specify how it should behave.
In drawing shapes, parameters define characteristics like position, size, and color.
Parameters allow customization, enabling precise control over what is drawn on the screen.
Commands Introduced:

background(color)

Sets the background color of the canvas.
Example: background("lightblue"); creates a light blue background.
ellipse(x, y, w, h)

Draws a circle or oval.
Parameters:
x, y: The coordinates of the center.
w, h: The width and height.
Example: ellipse(200, 150, 100, 50); draws an oval at (200, 150) with a width of 100 and height of 50.
rect(x, y, w, h)

Draws a rectangle.
Parameters:
x, y: The coordinates of the top-left corner.
w, h: The width and height.
Example: rect(100, 100, 200, 100); draws a rectangle starting at (100, 100) with a width of 200 and height of 100.
Benefits of Parameters:

Flexibility: Change a shape's position, size, or color easily by modifying parameters.
Reusability: Use the same command with different parameters to create diverse shapes.
Levels Overview
Predict (Level 1):

Analyze code and predict what will appear on the screen before running it.
Skill Building (Levels 2-6):

Practice using parameters to control shape properties like size, position, and color.
Practice (Level 7):

Combine commands and parameters to draw more complex visuals.
Assessment (Level 8):

Test your understanding by solving a task that involves using parameters effectively.
Challenges (Level 9):

Push creativity by creating designs that require thoughtful use of parameters.
Practical Example
To draw a scene with a sun, ground, and a house:

javascript
Copy code
// Background
background("skyblue");

// Ground
fill("green");
rect(0, 300, 400, 100);

// Sun
fill("yellow");
ellipse(350, 50, 80, 80);

// House
fill("red");
rect(100, 200, 150, 100);

// Roof
fill("brown");
triangle(100, 200, 250, 200, 175, 150);
Key Points When Using Parameters:
Ensure x and y coordinates align with your design layout.
Adjust width and height carefully for proportionate shapes.
Experiment with colors for visual appeal.
Learning Reflection
Parameters are powerful tools for customization and precision in drawing.
They allow you to create dynamic and complex visuals with just a few commands.
Debugging and understanding the effect of each parameter is crucial for mastering shape manipulation.
