Lesson 2 - Plotting Shapes
Key Concepts
Understanding the Game Lab Grid:

The grid is a coordinate system where you can draw shapes.
The origin (0,0) is located at the top-left corner of the screen.
The x-axis increases as you move right, and the y-axis increases as you move down.
Drawing Shapes:

Shapes are drawn using specific commands in Game Lab.
Common commands include:
rect(x, y, width, height) for rectangles.
ellipse(x, y, width, height) for circles and ovals.
line(x1, y1, x2, y2) for straight lines.
point(x, y) for single points.
Parameters:

Each shape command takes parameters that specify its position, size, and sometimes appearance (e.g., color).
Example:
rect(50, 100, 200, 150) draws a rectangle starting at (50, 100) with a width of 200 and a height of 150.
Order of Drawing:

Shapes are drawn in the order of the commands. Later commands can overlap earlier ones.
Steps to Plot a Shape:
Choose the type of shape you want to draw.
Determine the x and y coordinates for its starting position.
Decide the dimensions (width and height) or other parameters required.
Write the command in the Game Lab using the appropriate syntax.
Challenges in Communicating Instructions:
Clear communication is essential for accurately plotting shapes:
Ensure all parameters (x, y, width, height) are specified.
Describe the shapes in the correct order for layering.
Use a common reference point (e.g., the origin of the grid).
