                 Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose
The activity focuses on understanding interactive game and animation design through problem-solving processes, word searches, client-based design recommendations, and creative ideation. This helps in applying practical and theoretical knowledge to design choices, prototyping, and critical reflection.

1. Word Search: Essential Terminology
The word search includes terms like "Boolean," "Conditional," "Function," "Parameter," and "Variable," which are foundational for animation and game programming.
Objective: Quickly identify these terms to reinforce familiarity with programming and design language.

2. The Problem-Solving Process with Design:
Define: Identify users, assess needs, and set objectives.
Prepare: Research, brainstorm, and outline a testable solution.
Try: Develop a prototype, often sketched or minimally interactive.
Reflect: Gather feedback, present findings, and refine based on responses.

3. Choosing the Right Interactive Design for Clients
Template Recommendations: The activity involves selecting an appropriate design template for different clients based on their unique requirements. For instance:
Maria, a teacher, requires an educational design for young children.
Richard, an environmentalist, needs a game that teaches recycling.
Layla wants an engaging, heartwarming communication tool for her grandchildren.
Emma envisions an educational game featuring a shark to convey its harmless nature to humans.
Levi aims to turn comic book stories into interactive digital tales.

4. Creating a Custom Design
The task encourages students to build a design for selected clients, such as:
Tatiana, who wants interactive greeting cards with humorous puns.
Daniel, who aims for a simple, easy-to-play game featuring his grandmother's butterfly-chasing corgi.

5. Steps in Custom Design Creation
Define: Frame the design objective based on user needs.
Prepare: List necessary visuals, interactions, and thematic elements.
Try: Develop a prototype or sketch, translating ideas into a preliminary design.
Reflect: Evaluate the design's success in meeting user needs and consider potential improvements.
