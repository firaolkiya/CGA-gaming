Summary of Lecture 19 on Velocity
1. velocityX for Horizontal Movement:

The velocityX property allows sprites to move by a certain number of pixels horizontally each frame, using a simple velocity pattern.

Example:
var fish = createSprite(50, 150);
fish.setAnimation("orange_fish");
fish.velocityX = 1;  // Move the fish to the right
The velocityX = 1; line makes the fish move 1 pixel to the right every frame of the game.

2. Moving a Sprite Down (Using velocityY):

To move a sprite vertically (e.g., down), you can use the velocityY property.
Example to move the feather sprite down:

feather.velocityY = 1;  // Moves the feather down the screen
3. Controlling Rotation Speed:

The rotationSpeed property can be used to make a sprite rotate, and its speed can be controlled.
Example for rotating a wheel when the spacebar is pressed:

var wheel = createSprite(200, 200);
wheel.setAnimation("wheel");

function draw() {
  background("blue");

  if (keyWentDown("space")) {
    wheel.rotationSpeed = 2;  // Starts rotating when space is pressed
  }

  drawSprites();
}
4. Changing Velocity Based on Sprite's Position:

You can change the sprite's movement by checking its position using if statements.

Example:

var fish = createSprite(200, 200);
fish.setAnimation("fishR");
fish.velocityX = 2;

function draw() {
  background("blue");

  if (fish.x < 0) {
    fish.setAnimation("fishR");
    fish.velocityX = 2;  // Moves to the right
  }
  if (fish.x > 400) {
    fish.setAnimation("fishL");
    fish.velocityX = -2;  // Moves to the left when it goes off-screen
  }

  drawSprites();
}
What the code does:

The fish starts by moving to the right (due to fish.velocityX = 2).
When the fish reaches the left edge (x < 0), it switches animation and continues moving right.
When it reaches the right edge (x > 400), it switches animation again and moves left.
Key Concepts:
velocityX: Moves a sprite horizontally by the given value.
velocityY: Moves a sprite vertically by the given value.
rotationSpeed: Controls the speed of rotation for a sprite.
Conditionals (if statements): Used to change sprite behavior based on its position or interactions, such as reversing direction when the sprite hits the edge
