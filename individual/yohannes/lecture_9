                     Sprite Properties


Key Concepts
Sprite Properties:

Sprites have properties like x, y, width, height, rotation, and more. These properties define their appearance and behavior on the screen.
Example properties:
Position: sprite.x, sprite.y
Size: sprite.width, sprite.height
Rotation: sprite.rotation
Predicting Sprite Behavior:

Analyze the code to predict where sprites will appear or how they will look.
Understand the order of operations and how properties like position and animation affect the sprite.
Example 1: Predicting Bee Sprite Location
javascript
var bee = createSprite(200, 200);
bee.setAnimation("bee");
drawSprites();
Question: Where will the bee appear?

Answer: A. A bee sprite in the middle of the screen
The createSprite(200, 200) positions the bee at (200, 200), the center of a 400x400 canvas.
"What If..." Questions:

What happens if you change drawSprites() to appear before setAnimation()?
The sprite will still appear, but it might not display the correct animation.
What if the sprite's x or y values are negative?
The sprite might not appear on the canvas.
Example 2: Kite with Custom Animation
javascript
// Create kite sprite and set animation
var kite = createSprite(300, 50);
kite.setAnimation("kite");

// Draw background
background("skyblue");

// Draw grass
fill("green");
noStroke();
rect(0, 300, 400, 100);

// Draw string
stroke("black");
strokeWeight(5);
line(150, 300, 300, 50);

// Draw sprite
drawSprites();
Explanation:

Custom Animation:

The kite sprite is created at (300, 50) with the animation "kite".
To upload and use your own animation:
Use the Animation tab to upload an image and rename it (e.g., "kite").
Use setAnimation("kite") to apply the animation.
Background and Details:

The sky is drawn using background("skyblue").
Grass and the kite's string are added using shapes and lines.
