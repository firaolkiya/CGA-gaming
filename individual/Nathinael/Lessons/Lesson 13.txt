        Lesson 13 : Sprite Movement

Main idea :  How can we control sprite movement in Game Lab.

# its more of how we can control the direction , speed , rotation and scale of an object 
  with in the draw function
# making objects to move on a specific direction
# Making the animation of the objects and makes it more smooth.
# so it controls and makes animation smooth and look more apealing.


        CODE FROM GAME LAB

var blueGear = createSprite(100, 220);
blueGear.setAnimation("blue_gear");

var greenGear = createSprite(183, 298);
greenGear.setAnimation("green_gear");

var redGear = createSprite(185, 145);
redGear.setAnimation("red_gear");

function draw() {
  background("white");
    
    // 1 Make the gears rotate so they look like they are working as one system
  
  blueGear.rotation = blueGear.rotation - 3;
  greenGear.rotation = greenGear.rotation + 3;
  redGear.rotation = redGear.rotation + 3;
  
  drawSprites();
}
