        Lesson 22 : Complex Sprite Movement

Main idea :  How can previous blocks be combined in new patterns to make interesting movements.

# On this part using Verlocity x and y to increase or decrease the speed of different 
  sprites 
# activities like speeding cars up, slowing rockes and others...


    SOME CODE FROM THE GAME LAB

var car = createSprite(50, 200);
car.setAnimation("red_car");
car.velocityX = 0.2;

function draw() {
  background("gray");
  car.velocityX = car.velocityX + 0.1;


  
  drawSprites();
}
