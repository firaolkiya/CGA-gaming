     CODE FROM GAME LAB

var blueGear = createSprite(100, 220);
blueGear.setAnimation("blue_gear");

var greenGear = createSprite(183, 298);
greenGear.setAnimation("green_gear");

var redGear = createSprite(185, 145);
redGear.setAnimation("red_gear");

function draw() {
  background("white");
  if (keyDown("space")) {
    blueGear.rotation = blueGear.rotation - 1;
    greenGear.rotation = greenGear.rotation + 1;
    redGear.rotation = redGear.rotation + 1;
  }

  // 1 Add code that will check if the space key is being pressed down.
  // 2 Adjust the program so that the gears only rotate when the space key is pressed down.

  drawSprites();
}
