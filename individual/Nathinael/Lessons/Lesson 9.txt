        Lesson 9 : Sprite Properties

Main idea :How can we use sprite properties to change their appearance on the screen.

# Saw sprite properties such as 
# sprite.x and sprite.y to change the x andy position of the image,
# sprite.scale and sprite.rotation to control the scale and the rotation of the image.

        CODE FROM GAME LAB

  // 1 Run the program to see how what is different about the first two notes.

background("skyblue");
var drums = createSprite(200,290);
drums.setAnimation("drum_set");
var note1 = createSprite(50,50);
note1.setAnimation("eighth_note");
note1.scale = 0.3;
note1.rotation = 20;
var note2 = createSprite(150,50);
note2.setAnimation("eighth_note");
note2.scale = 0.7;
note2.rotation = -30;
var note3 = createSprite(250,50);
note3.setAnimation("eighth_note");
note3.scale = 0.5;
note3.rotation = 10;
var note4 = createSprite(350,50);
note4.setAnimation("eighth_note");
note4.scale = 0.4;
note4.rotation = -20;
drawSprites();
