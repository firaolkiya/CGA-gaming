        Lesson 8 : Sprites

Main idea : How can we use sprites to help us keep track of lots of information in our programs.

# Introduced to sprites
# there are biult in images in the game lab and used them with the use of sprites.
# First declare a var to initialize the sprite 
# then get the name of the animations
# finally display on the screen block

        CODE FROM GAME LAB

var fruit = createSprite(200, 100);

// Update the fruit animation

fruit.setAnimation("strawberry");
drawSprites();

var vegetable = createSprite(200, 300);

// Update the vegetable animation

vegetable.setAnimation("carrot");

drawSprites();
