        Lesson 12 : The Draw Loop

Main idea :  How can we animate our images in Game Lab.

# I saw how i can animate any drowing with in Game Lab
# a function is used to perform this function.
# the syntax is function draw () { actions }.
# and we can control the speed or the animation with the world.frameRate().
# in general its a loop function that enables us to animate objects.


        CODE FROM GAME LAB

  // Run the program to see how it works.

var pencil = createSprite(100,200);
pencil.setAnimation("pencil");

var brush = createSprite(300,200);
brush.setAnimation("brush");

function draw(){
  background("white");
  pencil.x = randomNumber(100,110);
  // 2 Edit the code in this program to make the second sprite shake like the first one.
  brush.x = randomNumber(290, 300);
  drawSprites();
}
