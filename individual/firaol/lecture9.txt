i can control sprites properties by using . symbol 

we change x and y position of the sprites

If you think of a sprite as a collection of values that represents an object in the real world, then the properties of a sprite are like variables that hold all of those values. Some of the most common sprite properties include:



Dot Notation
Notice that all of the examples above follow a common pattern of sprite label . sprite property. We call this format dot notation. The first part will always be unique to the sprite that you want to modify, and the second part will always be one of the properties common to all sprites.


//1) Make all of the cars look like they are traveling correctly down the roads
background("darkseagreen");
shape(150,0,250,0,250,130,400,-20,400,-15,400,121,250,271,250,400,150,400,150,250,0,250,0,150,150,150);
stroke("yellow");
line(200, 0, 200, 150);
line(0, 200, 150, 200);
line(200, 286, 200, 400);
line(250, 200, 400, 55);

var carTop = createSprite(225, 75);
carTop.setAnimation("car_green");
carTop.scale = 0.6;

var carLeft = createSprite(100, 225);
carLeft.setAnimation("car_red");
carLeft.scale = 0.6;

var carBottom = createSprite(175, 350);
carBottom.setAnimation("car_blue");
carBottom.scale = 0.6;

var carRight = createSprite(300, 185);
carRight.setAnimation("car_yellow");
carRight.scale = 0.6;
