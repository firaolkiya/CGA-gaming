The Draw Loop


To create animations, you'll need a way to keep drawing frame after frame. In Game Lab, this is done using the draw function. The way programs run in Game Lab is

Run every piece of code outside draw
Keep running the code inside draw over and over again, 30 times a second
Each time the code inside draw runs is like a new page in a flipbook. By making small changes to what's drawn each time, you can use Game Lab to create animations.
