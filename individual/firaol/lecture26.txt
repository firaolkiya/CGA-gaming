The Add new frame button adds a blank frame to your animation, which you can draw in. If you'd like to make a copy of your current frame to make slight edits, use (3)
The Trash Can icon will delete the current frame
The Copy icon will create a copy of the current frame, which you can then edit.
The Move icon lets you rearrange the order of your frames
The Onion icon shows a transparent overlay of the previous frame and the following frame. This is useful if you would like to make small changes to a frame to create a smoother animation, and make sure it aligns with the surrounding frames.
The Slider changes the speed of the animation. Moving to the right speeds-up the animation; moving to the left slows-down the animation. You can see a preview of your animation when you hover over it in this column.

Most games will involve sprites colliding with each other. There are four types of collisions available in Game Lab: displace, collide, bounce, and bounceOff. These blocks will cause a certain type of interaction between the sprite and its target and must be used within the draw function.

Displace

displace makes a sprite push another sprite (the target) as long as they are touching each other.

function draw() {

  background("skyblue");
  bunny.displace(carrot);
  drawSprites();

}

Collide

collide makes a sprite stop when it runs into things. You can use it when you want your sprite to be blocked by obstacles.

function draw() {

  background("black");
  alien.collide(monster);
  drawSprites();
 
}

Bounce

bounce makes the sprite and the target bounce when they touch each other. Both the sprite and the target change how they are moving.

function draw() {

  background("lightgreen");
  giraffe.bounce(hippo);
  elephant.bounce(pig);
  snake.bounce(monkey);
  drawSprites();
}

BounceOff

bounceOff makes the sprite bounce off the target when they touch each other. The target keeps moving as before.

function draw() {

  background("pink");
  note.bounceOff(guitar);
  drawSprites();
 
}
