Speeding Up
To speed up a sprite that has a positive velocity, you need to add to the velocity inside the counter pattern. To speed up a sprite with a negative velocity, you need to subtract from the velocity inside the counter pattern.

Going Up


flybot.velocityY = -1;

function draw() {
  background("black");
  flybot.velocityY = flybot.velocityY - 1;
  drawSprites(); 
}

Going Down


bone.velocityY = 1;

function draw() {
  background("black");
  bone.velocityY = bone.velocityY + 1;
  drawSprites();
}

Going Left


cart.velocityX = -1;

function draw() {
  background("black");
  cart.velocityX = cart.velocityX - 1;
  drawSprites();
}

Going Right


robot.velocityX = 1;

function draw() {
  background("black");
  robot.velocityX = robot.velocityX + 1;
  drawSprites();
}

Slowing Down
To slow down a sprite that has a positive velocity, you need to subtract from the velocity inside the counter pattern. To slow down a sprite with a negative velocity, you need to add to the velocity inside the counter pattern. Once a sprite has slowed down to a stop, it will start speeding in the other direction. This can make it look like your sprite is jumping or has been thrown in the air.

Going Up


bone.velocityY = -25;

function draw() {
  background("black");
  bone.velocityY = bone.velocityY + 1;
  drawSprites();
}

Going Right


cart.velocityX = 25;

function draw() {
  background("black");
  cart.velocityX = cart.velocityX - 1;
  drawSprites();
}

Stopping Your Sprite
If you want your sprite to stop, rather than start to move in the other direction, you'll need to use a conditional to check that the sprite is moving in the correct direction before you use the counter pattern, and stop the sprite if it isn't.



plane.velocityY = 25;

function draw() {
  background("black");
  if (plane.velocityY > 0) {
    plane.velocityY = plane.velocityY - 1;
  }
  drawSprites();
}

// GAME SETUP
// create player, target, and obstacles
var player = createSprite(200, 100);
player.setAnimation("fly_bot");
player.scale = 0.8;


function draw() {
  background("lightblue");
   background("lightblue");
  
  // FALLING
 background("lightblue");
  // LOOPING
  
  
  // PLAYER CONTROLS
  // change the y velocity when the user clicks "up"
  
  // decrease the x velocity when user clicks "left"
  
  // increase the x velocity when the user clicks "right"
  
  // SPRITE INTERACTIONS
  // reset the coin when the player touches it
  
  // make the obstacles push the player
  
  
  // DRAW SPRITES
  drawSprites();
  
  // GAME OVER
  if (player.x < -50 || player.x > 450 || player.y < -50 || player.y > 450) {
    background("black");
    textSize(50);
    fill("green");
    text("Game Over!", 50, 200);
  }
  
}
