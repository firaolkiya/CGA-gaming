I learned how to draw shapes using a tool that allows me to create shapes in different colors. I explored how to:

Change the color of the shapes by selecting a color before drawing.
Click on a shape icon every time I want to draw a new shape.
Turn on a grid for better alignment by checking the grid box below the "Run" button.
Start the program by clicking the "Run" button to activate the drawing tool.
This practice helped me understand the basics of creating and customizing shapes efficiently.
